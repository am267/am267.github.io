                <p class="subhead">Creating awareness of education, research, and opportunities to positively impact society is at the core of my professional goals which stem from my interest in matters that affect the geography of our planet and the education of its people. The evolving role of technology drives my research interests in UX and inclusive design that enhance socio-technical systems, cultivate inclusive communities, and encourage intellectual and cultural diversity.

                As part of administrative leadership, I am looked to for expertise in diversity, inclusion, and accessibility strategies. For inclusive strategies, I apply my UX research skills to foster a human-approach to improving services and engagement across departments. This is aided by extensive professional development training, including Oregon State University’s Search Advocates program, which includes 16-hours of unconscious bias and search committee training, and from experience serving as a chair and member of the Library Publishing Coalition’s <i>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion </i>Committee. Inclusive design is also used in the lab I manage where faculty and students can learn and apply digital technologies. The lab enables the experience of combining fieldwork research with technology to transform research into digital publication. Projects have included text analysis, interactive storymaps, thematic collections, digital exhibits, GIS-enabled research, and websites that incorporate hypermedia and data visualizations. The resources created with the programs I lead strive to be open and accessible with content disseminated through open repositories I administer. As a press director, I also oversee design and accessibility production for digital and print publications, and I developed the editorial guidelines for editors/authors, reviewers, and copyeditors of scholarly and creative works published by the imprint. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The curriculum and resources created with the press and programs I lead enable students to gain digital credentials needed for successful job placement and attempt to apply design thinking and UX research methods. Aside from imparting knowledge onto students, I also practice what I teach. For my designs, UX principles begin with empathy for users based on observation and ethnographic studies that turn into a research design for deeper assessment of user needs, environments, and behaviors. Outcomes of UX research produce personas, storyboards, and focus groups that effectively influence iterative developments of wireframes, prototypes including interaction designs, information architecture elements including taxonomy and navigation, and accessibility and usability testing phases.
                </p>
                <p>
                Using the stages of human-centered design (empathy, define, ideate, prototype, test, implement), projects have the chance to become more inclusive in their design and use. For example, UX research design practices can help remove barriers affecting users on various devices, with varying cognitive or physical abilities, and with different product use goals. This is the focus of my latest publication, a book chapter (in press) titled “Inclusive Design: A Method and Craft of Transforming DH with UX,” and complements my peer-reviewed articles on creative coding, UX engagement, sustainable digital project design, website discovery, and accessibility research, among others.

            <h3>Reflections on Research</h3>
            <p>Various experiences—including the experience of living in a completely homogeneous society different than my own culture and among people who have a disability—has given me a perspective that I bring with me to professional environments today. With this background and experience, I take a big picture and user-centered approach to design iterative and realistic solutions to user experience problems (for products, services, or programs). My research process includes the use of design thinking, validating user experiences, removing bias, and advocating for changes that affect edge cases (people at the margins) as their design often benefit the larger population. My research involves inclusive design—designing for the range of human differences—with a focus on age, disability, and language. This design emphasis is critical to creating user-friendly products, programs, and services that remove barriers, provide access, and enable useful and meaningful experiences to users. I use universal design, respect, and empathy to guide my research process, all part of my research ethos.  By designing with inclusivity at the beginning, we have a better chance of creating positive user experiences for the range of humans we have on the planet. 
            </p>
            <p>In my research, I primarily use mixed methods and case study methodology aided by user experience research methods (empathy research, task analysis, usability testing), descriptive statistics, and qualitative methods that include content analysis, thematic analysis, interviews, focus groups, and surveys. I focus on inclusive design methods as research practice (positionality). Given this experience, I hope to build on prior knowledge and learn how to create more accessible and usable information products such as websites or electronic books using inclusive surveys and usability testing environments. The inclusive mindset is a philosophical framework brought to both the scholarship and practice of the user experience (UX) and interdisciplinary fields.
            </p>
            <p>Despite the research and knowledge gained to date, I still desire to learn more. Through my dissertation work, I hope to learn how best to communicate with the disability community to promote a positive experience for research study participation. In a research context, this communication is done through the design of online surveys that are respectful, accessible, and usable, as well as communication via task analysis or usability studies where the human-computer interaction elements may impact various people differently. Learning about various disabilities and user preferences of web-based platforms are what I hope to apply and continuously improve upon in future research. Such human-centered approaches are also applicable to my teaching practices where my research and teaching practices inform each other. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Reflections on Teaching</h3>
            <p>I have extensive formal and informal education in accessibility, usability, and disability studies. Additionally, I have formal graduate education in understanding human behavior and designing programs, products, services, and spaces for diverse users. This design practice takes an inclusive mindset approach to solving problems and understanding root issues. Because of this, I strive to uncover best practices and user challenges in order to improve products, services, and spaces with diverse users in mind, including gender, race, ethnicity, language, culture, and disabilities such as autism spectrum disorder, vision, hearing, or other physical or cognitive abilities. I emphasize my background in this, as it is foundational to my teaching. Solving problems and understanding a person’s needs are also applicable to teaching. For example, when I taught at Kent State University, I had students coming from different disciplines, experiences, and who had access to different technologies. As part of my universal design approach to teaching, I have used responsive pedagogical practices to provide multiple viewpoints of curriculum content and context including hands-on and immersive experiences and altered assignments or provided assignment options so students had opportunities to choose the preferred assessment type based on their situation. I’ve also troubleshot technical challenges by finding accessible alternatives for students who don’t have the recommended hardware or software needed for the course. 
            </p>
            <p>I am able to change up assignments and create varied learning opportunities because I strive to stay current with educational practices and learning technologies. This is done through active involvement in service work that researches and applies new methods and technologies, while also attending conferences, webinars, and taking classes. I also learn from my colleagues and students, where we have respectful and curious conversations about trending topics in higher education and the impact on student success. These conversations and outcomes from my teaching experiences will also impact my research agenda as I continue to apply inclusive design frameworks to creative positive user experiences for diverse user needs.
