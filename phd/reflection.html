                <p class="subhead">Creating awareness of education, research, and opportunities to positively impact society is at the core of my professional goals which stem from my interest in matters that affect the geography of our planet and the education of its people. The evolving role of technology drives my research interests in UX and inclusive design that enhance socio-technical systems, cultivate inclusive communities, and encourage intellectual and cultural diversity.

                As part of administrative leadership, I am looked to for expertise in strategic communication and accessibility strategies. For inclusive strategies, I apply my UX research skills to foster a human-approach to improving services and engagement across departments. This is aided by extensive professional development training, including Oregon State University’s Search Advocates program, which includes 16-hours of unconscious bias and search committee training, and from experience serving as a chair and member of the Library Publishing Coalition’s committee that focuses on accessibility. Inclusive design is also used in the lab I manage where faculty and students can learn and apply digital technologies. The lab enables the experience of combining fieldwork research with technology to transform research into digital publication. Projects have included text analysis, wellness guides, interactive storymaps, thematic collections, digital archives and exhibits, GIS-enabled research, and websites that incorporate hypermedia and data visualizations. The resources created with the programs I lead strive to be open and accessible with content disseminated through open repositories I administer. As a press director, I also oversee design and accessibility production for digital and print publications, and I developed the editorial guidelines for editors/authors, reviewers, and copyeditors of scholarly and creative works published by the imprint. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The curriculum and resources created with the press and programs I lead enable students to gain digital credentials needed for successful job placement and attempt to apply design thinking and UX research methods. Aside from imparting knowledge onto students, I also practice what I teach. For my designs, UX principles begin with empathy for users based on observation and ethnographic studies that turn into a research design for deeper assessment of user needs, environments, and behaviors. Outcomes of UX research produce personas, storyboards, and focus groups that effectively influence iterative developments of wireframes, prototypes including interaction designs, information architecture elements including taxonomy and navigation, and accessibility and usability testing phases.

                <p>
                    Using the stages of human-centered design (empathy, define, ideate, prototype, test, implement), projects have the chance to become more inclusive in their design and use. For example, UX research design practices can help remove barriers affecting users on various devices, with varying cognitive or physical abilities, and with different product use goals. This is the focus of my latest publications, including a book chapter titled “Inclusive Design: A Method and Craft of Transforming Digital Humanities with User Experience,” and two articles titled “Healthcare UX: A case for Inclusive Designs that Impacts Aging and Anxiety,” “Disabilities and User Experience: An Exploratory Case Study of Survey and Website Accessibility," and "AI Tools, Algorithmic Literacies, and Educational Technology: Inclusive Design Impacts Accessibility and Design of AI in Education.” These works complement my peer-reviewed articles on creative coding, educational technology, information/communication design, UX engagement, text mining, sustainable digital project design, digital archive design, website discovery, and accessibility research, among others.

            <h3>Reflections on Research</h3>
            <p>I take a big picture and human-centered approach to design iterative and realistic solutions to user experience problems (for products, services, or programs). My research process includes the use of design thinking, validating user experiences, removing bias, and advocating for changes that affect edge cases (people at the margins) as their design often benefit the larger population. My research involves inclusive design—designing for the range of human differences—with a focus on age, disability, and language. This design emphasis is critical to creating user-friendly products, programs, and services that remove barriers, provide access, and enable useful and meaningful experiences to users. I use universal design, respect, and empathy to guide my research process, all part of my research ethos. By designing with inclusivity at the beginning, we have a better chance of creating positive user experiences for the range of humans we have on the planet.  
            </p>
            <p>Leading developments of socio-technical aspects (people, policies, technologies, communities) for digital projects requires a perspective of the people involved: the potential users and stakeholders. Both groups need people who come from varying disciplines, age groups, and economic or cultural backgrounds, and who have varying technical, cognitive, motor, and vision capabilities and research interests. The effective creation, education, and preservation of community cultivation and digital projects hinders on this makeup. I hope to apply this experience to socio-technical design of systems and products, and future work may look at how emerging technologies impact those research areas including advances in human-computer interaction, accessible research, human-centered artificial intelligence, and other communication design techniques that enable design for social impact.
