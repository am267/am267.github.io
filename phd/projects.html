        <h2 id="Experience">Experience</h2>
          <p>My research interests include user experience design and socio-technical systems. User experience design looks at design characteristics that result in poor user performance with a system or product and tries to improve a user’s experience with that system or product by researching user behavior—their wants, needs, and frustrations. Intercultural communication, communication design, and information behavior also impact these experiences.
          </p>

                These examples highlight how intuitive a product or system is, how information is laid out for discovery or navigation, and how frustrating or enjoyable it can be for the user. Researching how to design systems with a human-centered focus can impact the end user’s experience and their ultimate use of that system or product. Understanding how to create and design for the totality of those matters is something I research and design because it affects people around the world.

        <h4 id="Artifact1">Artifact 1—Inclusive Design Book Chapter</h4>
        <p>(2024) "Inclusive Design: A Method and Craft of Transforming Digital Humanities with User Experience,” In <em>Digital Humanities in the Library: Challenges and Opportunities for Subject Specialists</em>, Revised Second Edition, Eds. Arianne Hartsell-Gundy, Laura Braunstein, and Liorah Golomb. <em>Association of College & Research Libraries</em>. <a href="https://alastore.ala.org/digital-humanities-library-second-edition" target="_blank">(Storefront)</a> &nbsp;  <a href="https://jewlscholar.mtsu.edu/handle/mtsu/7396" target="_blank">(Repository link to chapter)</a></p>
  
       <p>When setting up surveys as part of your research, do you consider the language or purpose of the question? Are there leading questions? Have you considered the background or demographics of your audience? What about when setting up tasks for user testing a research project, do you strategize how to recruit users with a diverse approach or just try to get as many as possible? These are a mere fraction of the types of questions user experience (UX) professionals would consider when creating a digital application. These questions should also be asked by the creators of other digital projects. Though the focus is on using UX in DH, this chapter describes methodologies applicable to various disciplines and industries: design thinking or user-centered design, UX research, UX design, usability, accessibility, and inclusive design. They are interconnected, important, and useful to solving problems that affect the academy, social change, industry standards, and everyday interactions. Various disciplines and industries can also benefit from the included framework, an Inclusive Design Checklist, that helps project collaborators create and design for 1) the potential audience and intended audience, and 2) designing for both the expert user and casual user. Designing with users and addressing this framework will help increase many aspects of human diversity in web apps and digital projects. 
       </p>
       <p>This chapter provides an introduction of the problem and definitions of the UX field, an overview of the user-centered design phases and its applications, an overview of UX research and design phases and the importance of applying UX to DH. Then the chapter concludes with an inclusive design checklist that can help root the UX process in digital projects, regardless of the role of the subject specialist or reader of the book. This chapter is neither comprehensive nor definitive but intended to be helpful to those who are new to UX and inclusive design of digital projects.

        <h4 id="Artifact2">Artifact 2—UX Research Brief</h4>
        <p>(2023). UX Brief on Space Planning and Community-Centered Design.
         
      <p>Learning spaces and academic libraries regularly need to re-evaluate services and spaces to accommodate for the growing and changing user populations. Library users have varying preferences and needs when it comes to library space usage, including but not limited to solo workspace, group workspace, noise level preferences, seating comfort preferences, and service options. 
      </p>
      <p>The study utilized a community-centered design and qualitative mixed-methods approach to discover the user perception of “spot” selection in an academic library by interviewing ten library users. Users were selected across all four floors, and in different sections of the library in November 2022. The results suggest metrics for assessing and designing library spaces.

        <p>In retrospect, interviewing another set of users at a different time period (e.g. evening or weekend) or a different semester (e.g. spring or summer), would have given an additional perspective. As an experiment, I had users draw maps of their library knowledge during the interviews, a type of journey mapping based on memory. This process intended to correlate knowledge and memory and the results suggest metrics for assessing and designing library spaces. </p>

        <p>Regardless of the target industry (health, business, media, education, etc.), UX, HCI, and inclusive design can impact the end user’s experience of a system or product. I work and research to improve those experiences. Current research and publications in these areas are included below (citation and abstracts) and a full list of publications are in my CV.</p>
        <p>(Published 2025). <b>Interactive Design and Interaction Cost: Communicating and Designing with Digital 
          Media and User Experience Principles</b>. <a href="https://informationmatters.org/2025/04/interactive-design-and-interaction-cost-communicating-and-designing-with-digital-media-and-user-experience-principles/" target="_blank">Information Matters, Vol. 5 (4)</a>.

          </p>
          <p>Communication technologies help people communicate with each other, whether through email, computer-mediated technologies such as message boards and Internet forums, and through voice, video, or conferencing systems, and the long list of new media (virtual reality, augmented reality, AI communication, podcasts, video sharing platforms, etc.). These communication technologies influence social and cultural transformations by evolving how people communicate, impacting the patterns of communication they use, and resulting in social interactions designed and carried out through a web-based environment. Communication is a process, where messages progress over time and create an interactive relationship among the communicators. This communication occurs in context to the environment of the interaction. Thus, computer-mediated communication requires human communication and interactive communication design principles to work together. For this, there is a need to focus on the interactive nature of web-based environments and design communication and tools for that context. Understanding user behavior through communication technologies, UX research methods, and applying UX principles in the design of a product can increase usability and user satisfaction. Without UX principles, communication and media designs and the organizations that use them risk alienating the customer or user experience, impacting the interaction cost.</p>

          <p>The intention of a design matters: Better health by design can become a reality when inclusive design leads the way. For example, applying inclusive design for holistic wellness, aging, and mental health reduces elements that may aggravate symptoms of a challenge, disability, or some stress-inducing factors. This Healthcare UX design approach is a process of creating a digital experience that addresses the needs of healthcare users, including healthcare patients and their providers, plus the families and caregivers of the healthcare-services users. Digital healthcare products should be intuitive, effective, and useful so people get the care they need. This article looks at how healthcare can apply UX design to overcome or prevent potential challenges and frustrations from using technologies for health-related reasons. Despite challenges presented that initially addressed older people or people with anxiety, the inclusive design approach helps to broaden its application to include other people who may be impacted by the same health and ability-based design challenges (such as people with different visual, physical, or neuro-behavioral difficulties). Thus, Healthcare UX principles apply to a larger population by design. </p>
          <p>(Published 2024). <b>Disabilities and User Experience: An Exploratory Case Study of Survey and Website Accessibility</b>. Journal of 
            Accessibility and Design for All. </p>
            <p>There is a lack of research regarding the challenges experienced by people with disabilities when taking surveys or participating in usability testing. Websites, digital health applications, and electronic books are products users are recruited to evaluate through surveys and usability tests. However, these products and the instruments used to evaluate them aren’t necessarily developed with the intended users being people with disabilities. Although some products use accessibility and usability practices when designing products, they vary in quality and quantity. Before a product—the website or electronic book—can move to production, it needs to be tested by a sample of people who are potential users but there is a lack of research on accessible instrument design that would make the user testing population and practices more inclusive. The purpose of this case study is to address this lack of research; and understand the experiences, challenges, and preferences of diverse users when participating in research studies through three forms of data collection: an interview, observation, and document analysis. The interview explores the experiences and observations encountered by a disability services professional at a public research institution. This data is triangulated with content analysis from a relevant document that describes 12 disability personas and an observation about accessible web design for people with cognitive disabilities. Two main themes emerged in the findings: Challenges and frustrations for people with disabilities and advice or guidance for information design. The triangulated analysis brings forth accessible design considerations for future research, practical advice for survey and usability testing with the disability community, and new questions for future research on inclusive instrument design. </p>
            <p>(Under review). <b>Inclusive Instrument Design: A Co-Design Multiple Methods Study of Accessibility and Diverse Abilities</b>. (This study is part of my dissertation, and this article is under review as of fall 2024). 
            </p>
            <p>Research study designs often focus on neuro-typical and abled-bodied populations, and information on accessible instrument design is difficult to locate in scholarly literature. This study fills the research gap by looking at inclusive instrument design for diverse user abilities through a co-design process and an inclusive design philosophy to understand the lived experiences and preferences of people with disabilities, impairments, or chronic conditions who participate in research studies using standard research instruments (including online surveys, interview protocols, or usability testing of web products). With a human-computer interaction and disability studies perspective, this study’s interest is identifying broader group preferences among a range of human abilities to create more inclusive research instruments. Using a qualitative mixed methods research methodology, data from co-design, expert reviews, surveys, and interviews were analyzed to understand the user experience of a group of people (online survey takers with and without disabilities, impairments, or chronic conditions). The instruments were created based on the author’s previous studies, with portions adapted from demographic questions found in the literature and those co-designed with collaborators with at least one disability. Once the inclusive instrument design prototype was developed through the co-design process, participants with and without disabilities were invited to take the survey about their experience of online surveys, interviews, or user testing sessions. Subsequent semi-structured interviews occurred with participants who took the survey and had at least one type of disability, impairment, or chronic condition. In addition to the thematic analysis of the co-design, survey data, and interviews, this study also involved user testing of common survey tools and professional survey accessibility testing and concludes with practical, theoretical, and methodological implications for co-design as a method and a framework for an inclusive instrument design model.  </p>
            <p>(Under review). <b>Human-Computer Interaction, Inclusive Design, and User Interface Implications for Information Kiosks: A Communication Design Study of Task Analysis and Usability. </b>
                </p> 
              <p>The current ticket kiosks used in a U.S.-based metro transportation system is out of date and confusing for infrequent travelers to that area. Research and design solutions have been developed to overcome the existing challenges after the initial user research phase. This study also involves the evaluation of a ticket kiosk’s user interface using screeners to recruit participants who have previously purchased tickets via an interface, and the use of scenarios and tasks to identify usability and design issues. Iterative testing and design included testing feedback sessions as part of this pilot study. The use of websites for interactive prototypes are also used to track first-clicks and task completion. With a design thinking approach and use of a think aloud protocol, iterative designs and evaluation were conducted with a particular focus on inclusive design aspects. The inclusive design recommendations are broadly applicable for other uses. For example, the same accessible and inclusive design process can be beneficial to ticket kiosks at airports, used in a lobby for reserving concert tickets, used in waiting rooms for healthcare providers, paying parking fees, or tickets for entrance to museums, amusement parks, and utility bill, hospital or medical payments, and more.

           <p>(Forthcoming). Two articles on AI tools and educational technology: <b>1. Ensuring Human-Centered AI EdTech: Inclusive Design and Evolving Information, Digital, Media, and 
            Algorithmic Literacies</b> and <b>2. Integrating AI in Education: Educational Technology Practices, Tools, and Accessibility</b>
                </p> 
              <p>The first article breaks down the differences between information, digital, media, and algorithmic literacy and introduces readers to human-centered design principles for educational technology. The second article takes that knowledge and discusses examples of integration of AI in education, including AI domains, AI and EdTech tool lists, and accessibility concerns. In combination, the two AI in education articles examine how inclusive and human-centered design can help overcome or prevent potential challenges and frustrations from using AI tools and technologies in education.

      <p>I teach workshops and guest lectures on digital humanities, web apps, project design, digital publishing, and UX/UI design. I try to incorporate research elements where students can apply skills learned and have products that may be suited for their goals: a piece for their portfolio, a paper or product to present at conferences, or a digital design experience that helps prepare them for job applications or graduate school admissions. I use the products I have created for professional practice or in my own graduate coursework as examples (reminder app, web form, 10-foot streaming interface, repository app) for students seeking consultation on design ideas where I emphasize experimentation, practicality, and design thinking. For some students, this is a motivating factor to switch majors/minors into experience design or is the missing gap in their curriculum that helps meet career goals.
        </p>
      <p>One of my graduate students created a help guide on the topic of wellness (emotional, financial, mental, physical, etc.). As the student’s mentor, I guided her learning process of this topic through inclusive design practices. This included the topics of research, empathy, accessibility, and information architecture (navigation and discovery). Once the research layers were complete, I set up the infrastructure for the transfer of her research into a web-based guide that is now available for public use. This Wellness Guide later won best in category (digital exhibit) for the PR Xchange award in 2024. View the <a href="https://library.mtsu.edu/wellness" target="blank">Wellness Guide</a>.

     <h4 id="Artifact7">Artifact 7—Ticket Kiosk</h4>
     <p>(2023). Human Computer Interaction and Inclusive Design Implications for Ticket Kiosks: 
      A Pilot Study of Task Analysis and Usability.
      </p>
      <p>The current ticket kiosks used in a U.S.-based metro transportation system is out of date and confusing for infrequent travelers to that area. Research and design solutions have been developed to overcome the existing challenges after the initial user research phase. This study involved the evaluation of a ticket kiosk’s user interface using screeners to recruit 3-12 participants who have previously purchased tickets via an interface, and the use of scenarios and tasks to identify usability and design issues. Iterative testing and design included two testing feedback sessions as part of the pilot study. The use of Figma for interactive prototypes are also used to track first-clicks and task completion. With a design thinking approach and use of a think aloud protocol, iterative designs and evaluation were conducted with a particular focus on inclusive design aspects.
        </p>
      <p>The hierarchical task analysis diagram was improved upon with wireframes for the proposed kiosk. A wireframe typically focuses on the functionality and physical layout of the design, without color or graphics. The wireframes are based on pain points discovered in user research and the literature review. Iterating on wireframe drafts led to the creation of a prototype based on the wireframes. The wireframes and prototypes were created based on a specific scenario and tasks: Infrequent passengers traveling via the metro in Washington, D.C.

      <img src="map.jpg" alt="map overlay in kiosk" class="responsive"><br>
      <p>In addition to the slew of wireframes, there is an interactive prototype available via Figma. Both the interactive prototype and the annotated mockup show other options in the UI, such as adding value to an existing farecard or purchasing a pass, however, the wireframes and prototypes were solely designed for infrequent passengers per the parameters of the pilot study. It is possible future studies could involve wider design implications for the other purchase options, such as, iterating between challenging assumptions (ideate) with language barriers and the solution for it (protoype).
        </p>
      <p>Looking at inclusive design implications for a ticket kiosk can help relieve anxiety of infrequent travelers in an unfamiliar area. Additionally, because of the universality of the design, the kiosks will also benefit frequent users as initial results of user testing indicate. This pilot study focused on user research and inclusive design aspects to improve current designs in use and future research is needed, especially with more user testing sessions. The inclusive design features included user preferences for language selection options (at any time of purchase process), search/navigation preferences (browse by list, browse by map, search by typing), payment options, and notifications of actions selected. These features give users control and flexibility. 
        </p>
      <p>The iterative design and inclusive design recommendations are broadly applicable for other uses. For example, the same accessible and inclusive design process can be beneficial to ticket kiosks at airports, used in a lobby for reserving concert tickets, paying parking fees, or tickets for entrance to museums, amusement parks, utility bill payments, hospital or medical payments, gym memberships, and more.

    <h4 id="Artifact8">Artifact 8—Developing a New Press Imprint and Publishing System</h4>
        <p>The MT Open Press publishing system development included platform evaluation, selection, and development. 
          After evaluating open source and proprietary systems options, selected Open Monograph Press (OMP) by the Public Knowledge Project. This open source software was implemented as the infrastructure for publishing monographs and textbooks. Among the features evaluated, implemented plugins that will help with information design, indexing with critical identifier systems such as the PKP Preservation Network (for archiving), DOAB (for indexing), custom blocks (for unique messaging for the audience), and more. System content uses HTML, CSS, and information architecture to effectively enable users to discover, navigate, and read books online for free. I also set up the infrastructure to enable the purchase of print-on-demand books via an external vendor. I also designed the logo, site color scheme, and tested the desktop and mobile viewports prior to launching the platform.
          </p>
        <p>Prior to the systems development of this publishing platform, there was extensive research done to create a systematic press process. This included strategic communication and business plan development, as well as  writing agreements for use with potential authors, editors, consultants, and service providers. After drafting these agreements, I met with various legal counsels to ensure the agreements were accurate and appropriate for the press and university. Workflow development included:
            </p>
            <p class="tab">Business plan and strategic communication development</p>
            <p class="tab">External reviewer processes (e.g. finding and evaluating potential external reviewers to access the quality of books under review including guidance documents and payment processes for their time).
          </p>
            <p class="tab">Workflows for call for proposals, author submission, and evaluation criteria.</p>
            <p class="tab">Developmental and copy-editing workflows, including checks for plagiarism, copyright, and citation accuracy.</p>
            <p class="tab">Cover design based on author feedback and sound visual communication strategies.</p>
            <p class="tab">Layout and typesetting processes and tools for digital and print books.</p>
            <p class="tab">Workflows for indexing in databases and search engines, including Worldcat, DOAB, and book reviewer sites.</p>
            <p class="tab">Research and implementation of ISBN, DOI, LCCN, and barcodes needed for discovery and commercialization best practices.</p>
            <p class="tab">Workflows for press release information, news posts, SEO strategies, and marketing materials such as book launch promos, design briefs, and other promotional materials.</p>
          <p>The above workflows, plus several others, were documented in the Press Business Plan and in subsequent internal workflows in order to create consistency and transparent processes. The <a href="https://openpress.mtsu.edu">new press</a> has successfully published two monographs since development in 2023 with over 8,000 downloads.</p>

      <p><b>Game Design</b></p>
        <p>An interactive ‘choose your own adventure’ orientation game with focus on educational learning and engagement. Developed in Twine, an open-source tool for telling non-linear stories with adaptions for gamification assessment as it relates to educational objectives and user engagement. Applied five phases of human-centered design: empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and test. Conducted user research, personas, data flow, wireframes, prototypes and testing. </p>
        <p>Role: Graphic Designer, Developer, Information Architect, Interaction Designer, IRB research study and case study co-author.</p>
        <p>With the five phases of user-centered design, coupled with iterative development throughout the phases, I designed a development approach for gamifying the library orientation experience. This development included the design, testing, and launch of a digital game, including evaluation of the game platform, coding the scoring algorithm, designing the player characters/personas and the storyline, and implementing the game architecture. Prior to launching the game, iterative testing was done with two groups of play testers and results discussed in two peer-reviewed articles. 
          </p>
          <p><img src="gameflow.png" alt="gamde design flow" class="responsive"></p>
    <br>
        <p>The systems development process for the game design included:

        <p class="tab"><b>Context and approach used a human centered design methodology</b></p>
        <p class="tab"> 1. Empathy, 2 definition, 3 ideation, 4 prototyping, 5 testing</p>
        <p class="tab"><b>Implementation</b> 
          <p class="tab">1. literature and local: environmental, contextual </p>
          <p class="tab">2. research, buy-in, stakeholders, IRB, survey design, event design </p>
          <p class="tab">3. brainstorm, personas, POIs (storyboard), workflows</p>
          <p class="tab">4. low/high-fidelity, code development; marketing prototypes </p>
          <p class="tab">5. testing: (code testing: random, screen/paper proofing, playtesters; observational: ie first-click tests; think-aloud reactions, feedback);  playtesting results (coding): ethnographic register of reactions in survey form; debugging.</p>
        <p>As a result of the process outline above (and detailed in published articles), I learned that design thinking/human centered design and gamification are mutually beneficial practices. Although helpful, it is not enough to have technical skills or a mechanically functioning game. Rather it is empathy that is the foundation to good design as people will not care to play because of a lack of interest, appeal, or relevance to user preferences. Game designers should understand how to engage with users, assess what makes them interested in learning, and identify how to motivate such participation. Designing with empathy will enhance any technical design and create a more enjoyable user experience. </p>

          In retrospect, this is a short list of systems and software. As technology changes, so does the need to adapt or adopt different practices and software skills. The focus is more on the workflows needed, rather than the software. Software will always change, but information architecture and content management will always been crucial for the accuracy, usability, and preservation of information systems and their information retrieval processes.
