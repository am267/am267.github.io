        <h1>About Me</h1>
    <blockquote> <em>I take a broad approach to UX via the intersection of design thinking, information science and user advocacy, where research is key to meaningful design.</em></blockquote>
    <p>As a scholar-practitioner with dual graduate degrees in user experience design and information science, my interests include user experience (UX), usability, accessibility, open access publishing, and preservation. My experience includes full-cycle UX research and design practices, including user research, information design, information architecture, interaction design, usability, dissemination, SEO, and documentation. In addition to my strengths in digital publishing and preservation, <strong> my area of specialization is inclusive design</strong>&#8212;the accessibility and usability of information products and services.
