                <p class="subhead">Creating awareness of education, research, and opportunities to positively impact society is at the core of my professional goals which stem from my interest in matters that affect the geography of our planet and the education of its people. The evolving role of technology drives my research interests in UX and inclusive design that enhance socio-technical systems, cultivate inclusive communities, and encourage intellectual and cultural diversity.

                As part of administrative leadership, I am looked to for expertise in diversity, inclusion, and accessibility strategies. For inclusive strategies, I apply my UX research skills to foster a human-approach to improving services and engagement across departments. This is aided by extensive professional development training, including Oregon State University’s Search Advocates program, which includes 16-hours of unconscious bias and search committee training, and from experience serving as a chair and member of the Library Publishing Coalition’s <i>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion </i>Committee. Inclusive design is also used in the lab I manage where faculty and students can learn and apply digital technologies. The lab enables the experience of combining fieldwork research with technology to transform research into digital publication. Projects have included text analysis, interactive storymaps, thematic collections, digital exhibits, GIS-enabled research, and websites that incorporate hypermedia and data visualizations. The resources created with the programs I lead strive to be open and accessible with content disseminated through open repositories I administer. As a press director, I also oversee design and accessibility production for digital and print publications, and I developed the editorial guidelines for editors/authors, reviewers, and copyeditors of scholarly and creative works published by the imprint. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The curriculum and resources created with the press and programs I lead enable students to gain digital credentials needed for successful job placement and attempt to apply design thinking and UX research methods. Aside from imparting knowledge onto students, I also practice what I teach. For my designs, UX principles begin with empathy for users based on observation and ethnographic studies that turn into a research design for deeper assessment of user needs, environments, and behaviors. Outcomes of UX research produce personas, storyboards, and focus groups that effectively influence iterative developments of wireframes, prototypes including interaction designs, information architecture elements including taxonomy and navigation, and accessibility and usability testing phases.

                <p>
                Using the stages of human-centered design (empathy, define, ideate, prototype, test, implement), projects have the chance to become more inclusive in their design and use. For example, UX research design practices can help remove barriers affecting users on various devices, with varying cognitive or physical abilities, and with different product use goals. This is the focus of my latest publication, a book chapter (in press) titled “Inclusive Design: A Method and Craft of Transforming DH with UX,” and complements my peer-reviewed articles on creative coding, UX engagement, sustainable digital project design, website discovery, and accessibility research, among others.
